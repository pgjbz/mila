# Mila
What is Mila?

Mila as programme language written in Rust, this lang is a reimplementation of [bzr](https://github.com/pgjbz/bzr), but improved, and removed useless type check in let statements, and real immutable `let` stataments and mutabble `var` statements.

This lang supports objects like:

```mila
let my_object = {
    foo: "bar"
};
```

Supports floating points like:

```mila
let floating_pointers = 1047.0;
```

Supports numbers like:

```mila
let numbers = 100;
```

Supports booleans like:

```mila
let is_mila_lang = true;
```
